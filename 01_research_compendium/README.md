# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

For "Deliverable 1: Reproducible research compendium", I have made a compendium for the simulation study discussed in week 4. 

All that is necessary to reproduce these findings can be found in this folder. All that you need to do to get the same results as me is to open my .Rproj file, use renv::restore() to make sure you are working with the same packages and version and then render the .qmd file which can be found under files. This should render you the same html file as me. Rendering the .qmd might take a few minutes since it will run a simulation study.
