  abstract = {The presence of outliers, which are data points that deviate markedly from others, is one of the most enduring and pervasive methodological challenges in organizational science research. We provide evidence that different ways of defining, identifying, and handling outliers alter substantive research conclusions. Then, we report results of a literature review of 46 methodological sources (i.e., journal articles, book chapters, and books) addressing the topic of outliers, as well as 232 organizational science journal articles mentioning issues about outliers. Our literature review uncovered (a) 14 unique and mutually exclusive outlier definitions, 39 outlier identification techniques, and 20 different ways of handling outliers; (b) inconsistencies in how outliers are defined, identified, and handled in various methodological sources; and (c) confusion and lack of transparency in how outliers are addressed by substantive researchers. We offer guidelines, including decision-making trees, that researchers can follow to define, identify, and handle error, interesting, and influential (i.e., model fit and prediction) outliers. Although our emphasis is on regression, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling, our general framework forms the basis for a research agenda regarding outliers in the context of other data-analytic approaches. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the consistency and transparency of practices regarding the treatment of outliers in organizational science research.},

A survey of recent papers published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General shows that both methods are widely used, and common data visualization techniques suggest that outliers should be excluded at the condition-level. However, I highlight in the present paper that removing outliers by condition runs against the logic of hypothesis testing, and that this practice leads to unacceptable increases in false-positive rates. I demonstrate that this conclusion holds true across a variety of statistical tests, exclusion criterion and cutoffs, sample sizes, and data types, and shows in simulated experiments and in a reanalysis of existing data that by-condition exclusions can result in false-positive rates as high as 43\%. I finally demonstrate that by-condition exclusions are a specific case of a more general issue: Any outlier exclusion procedure that is not blind to the hypothesis that researchers want to test may result in inflated Type I errors. I conclude by offering best practices and recommendations for excluding outliers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

Confirmatory factor analysis suggests that the proposed three factor structure for empathy and four factor structure for Machiavellianism fit the data better than other conceptions. From the previous research we expected empathy to be significantly higher in females, and also that the gender difference on the emotional reactivity subfactor would be highest. Males were expected to score higher on Machiavellianism. All of these results were found. From the pattern of results it is suggested that an EQ, Machiavellianism dichotomy makes more sense and has better empirical support than the proposed EQ/SQ distinction of Baron-Cohen. The problems of assuming unidimensionality for the EQ or any scale, based on limited evidence, are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The antagonistic personality trait Machiavellianism (Mach) should be characterized by duplicity, proclivity to manipulation, cynical disregard of others, long-term planning, and low aggression. Opposed to theoretical descriptions, recent studies revealed links between Mach and neuroticism, impulsivity, and aggression. The advantages of a multidimensional assessment of Mach are well known but were seldom implemented. Hence, differential effects within Mach have often been neglected. Based on previous research on basic motivational orientations, we derived two facets-Machiavellian approach and Machiavellian avoidance. These facets account for exploitative, strategic striving for resources and for misanthropic, distrustful loss prevention, respectively. In two studies (total N = 1,000, 21\% men), we found support for the two-factor structure, for measurement invariance across sexes, and the nomological network of the eight-item Machiavellian Approach and Avoidance Questionnaire (MaaQ). As expected, Machiavellian approach was primarily associated with hope for power, whereas Machiavellian avoidance was linked to affective criteria and aggression. Both approach and avoidance shared links with disagreeableness, dishonesty, and cynicism. Furthermore, they correlated with other Mach scales. The findings explain counterintuitive links with other constructs found in earlier studies and thereby further the understanding of Mach.

We compared these attributes among flowering plants, grasshoppers, butterflies, lizards, summer birds, winter birds, and rodents across 48 plots in the grasslands and mesquite--oak savannas of southeastern Arizona. Species richness and evenness were uncorrelated or weakly negatively correlated for each taxonomic group, supporting the conclusion that richness alone is an incomplete measure of diversity. In each case, richness was positively correlated with one or more measures of abundance. By contrast, evenness usually was negatively correlated with the abundance variables, reflecting the fact that plots with high evenness generally were those where all species present were about equally uncommon. Therefore richness, but not evenness, usually was a positive predictor of places of conservation value, if these are defined as places where species of interest are especially abundant. Species diversity was more positively correlated with evenness than with richness among grasshoppers and flowering plants, in contrast to the other taxonomic groups, and the positive correlations between richness and abundance were comparatively weak for grasshoppers and plants as well. Both of these differences can be attributed to the fact that assemblages of plants and grasshoppers were numerically dominated by small subsets of common species (grasses and certain spur-throated grasshoppers) whose abundances differed greatly among plots in ways unrelated to species richness of the groups as a whole.},

However, people also care about maintaining a favourable view of themselves (they want to maintain a `positive self-concept'), and may prefer to see themselves as `green' rather than `greedy'. Consequently, people may find economic appeals less attractive than biospheric appeals. Across two studies, participants indicated feeling better about biospheric (`Want to protect the environment? Check your car's tire pressure') than economic (`Want to save money? Check your car's tire pressure') tyre-check appeals. In a field experiment, we found that an economic tyre-check appeal (`Do you care about your finances? Get a free tire check') elicited significantly less compliance than parallel biospheric and neutral appeals. Together, these studies discredit the conventional wisdom that appealing to economic self-interest is the best way to secure behaviour change. At least in some cases, our studies suggest, this strategy is not effective.},

From 39 independent samples (N = 11,819), we found that Machiavellianism positively relates to entrepreneurial intention (rc = 0.16) and negatively relates to entrepreneurial performance (rc = -0.22), narcissism positively relates to entrepreneurial intention (rc = 0.24) and entrepreneurial performance (rc = 0.09), and psychopathy positively relates to entrepreneurial intention (rc = 0.17) and negatively relates to entrepreneurial performance (rc = -0.10). Amid conflicting empirical results and theoretical viewpoints, we leverage our findings to present an exploration into how and why the Dark Triad personality traits relate to the initiation and performance of entrepreneurship. We interpret the existing literature through the lens of Nietzsche's will to power and propose that power acquired over others (domination) is likely to be as viable a predictor of entrepreneurial agency as power removed from others (emancipation). Limitations to the primary studies included in our review are thoroughly examined, and we offer direction for future research.}

Participants were 232 North American adult twin pairs who completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, the MACH-IV, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results revealed that alexithymia correlates significantly and positively with psychopathy and Machiavellianism, and negatively with narcissism. Subsequent bivariate behavioral genetic analysis demonstrated that these phenotypic correlations were primarily attributable to common genetic and common non-shared environmental factors. The implication of these findings regarding the maladaptive functions of alexithymia within the antisocial realm of behavior and the need for replication are discussed.},

It is becoming increasingly popular in all subfields of psychology and beyond. Adherence to the preregistration plan may not always be feasible and even is not necessarily desirable, but without disclosure of deviations, readers who do not carefully consult the preregistration plan might get the incorrect impression that the study was exactly conducted and reported as planned. In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in Psychological Science between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

Although its theoretically positive relations with facets of Conscientiousness should help distinguish Machiavellianism from psychopathy, current measurements of Machiavellianism are indistinguishable from those of psychopathy in large part because of their assessment of low Conscientiousness. The goal of the present study was to create a measure of Machiavellianism that is more in line with theory using an expert-derived profile based on the 30 facets of the five-factor model (FFM) and then test the validity of that measure by comparing it with relevant constructs. Previously collected expert ratings of the prototypical Machiavellian individual on FFM facets yielded a profile of 13 facets including low Agreeableness and high Conscientiousness. Items were written to represent each facet, resulting in a 201-item Five Factor Machiavellianism Inventory (FFMI). Across 2 studies, with a total of 710 participants recruited via Mechanical Turk, the FFMI was reduced to its final 52-item form and was shown to relate as expected to measures of Big Five personality traits, current Machiavellianism measures, psychopathy, narcissism, ambition, and impulsivity. The FFMI is a promising alternative Machiavellianism measure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, both confirmatory factor models and the existence of missing data have generally been ignored in this debate. This article presents a simulation study that compares the reliability of sum scores, regression-based and expected posterior methods for factor score estimation for confirmatory factor models in the presence of missing data. Although all methods perform reasonably well with complete data, expected posterior-weighted (full) maximum likelihood methods are significantly more reliable than sum scores and regression estimators in the presence of missing data. Factor score reliability for complete data can be predicted by  formula for factor communality. Furthermore, factor score reliability for incomplete data can be reasonably approximated by communality raised to the  11-P(Missing) power. An empirical demonstration shows that the full maximum likelihood method best preserves the relationship between nicotine dependence and a genetic predictor under missing data. Implications and recommendations for applied research are discussed.},

We observe largely favorable private attitudes toward widespread lifetime usage (meaning that a researcher has used a particular practice at least once) of open science practices. As of 2020, nearly 90\% of scholars had ever used at least one such practice. Support for posting data or code online is higher (88\% overall support and nearly at the ceiling in some fields) than support for pre-registration (58\% overall). With respect to norms, there is evidence that the scholars in our sample appear to underestimate the use of open science practices in their field. We also document that the reported lifetime prevalence of open science practices increased from 49\% in 2010 to 87\% a decade later.},

Specifically, we introduced the progression of eucalypt plantations on a two-year basis to capture the influence of land cover changes over fire likelihood consistently. Fire occurrences in the period 2010--2016 were retrieved from the Brazilian Institute of Space Research (INPE) database. In terms of the AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), the model denoted fairly good predictive accuracy (AUC {$\approx$} 0.72). Results suggested that fire occurrence was mainly linked to proximity agricultural and to urban interfaces. Eucalypt plantation contributed to increased wildfire likelihood and denoted fairly high importance as an explanatory variable (17\% increase of Mean Square Error [MSE]). Nevertheless, agriculture and urban interfaces proved to be the main drivers, contributing to decreasing the RF's MSE in 42\% and 38\%, respectively. Furthermore, eucalypt plantations expansion is progressing over clusters of high wildfire likelihood, thus increasing the exposure to wildfire events for young eucalypt plantations and nearby areas. Protective measures should be focus on in the mapped Hot Spot zones in order to mitigate the exposure to fire events and to contribute for an efficient initial suppression rather than costly firefighting.},

  abstract = {Study preregistration is one of several ``open science'' practices (e.g., open data, preprints) that researchers use to improve the transparency and rigour of their research. As more researchers adopt preregistration as a regular practice, examining the nature and content of preregistrations can help identify the strengths and weaknesses of current practices. The value of preregistration, in part, relates to the specificity of the study plan and the extent to which investigators adhere to this plan. We identified 53 preregistrations from the gambling studies field meeting our predefined eligibility criteria and scored their level of specificity using a 23-item protocol developed to measure the extent to which a clear and exhaustive preregistration plan restricts various researcher degrees of freedom (RDoF; i.e., the many methodological choices available to researchers when collecting and analysing data, and when reporting their findings). We also scored studies on a 32-item protocol that measured adherence to the preregistered plan in the study manuscript. We found gambling preregistrations had low specificity levels on most RDoF. However, a comparison with a sample of cross-disciplinary preregistrations (N = 52; Bakker et al., 2020) indicated that gambling preregistrations scored higher on 12 (of 29) items. Thirteen (65\%) of the 20 associated published articles or preprints deviated from the protocol without declaring as much (the mean number of undeclared deviations per article was 2.25, SD = 2.34). Overall, while we found improvements in specificity and adherence over time (2017-2020), our findings suggest the purported benefits of preregistration---including increasing transparency and reducing RDoF---are not fully achieved by current practices. Using our findings, we provide 10 practical recommendations that can be used to support and refine preregistration practices.},

  abstract = {1. Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale. 2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness--productivity relationship. 3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive. 4. Synthesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity--ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.},

Geiss (1970) implicitly assume that the component beliefs of Machiavelli's philosophy are linked to other personality traits only as mediated by a central dimension of Machiavellianism. This assertion was cast in the form of a causal model and shown to be false among 351 undergraduates. Ss completed a test battery that included the Mach IV Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis identified 4 component beliefs: flattery, rejection of honesty, rejection of the belief that people are moral, and the belief that people are vicious and untrustworthy. These beliefs differentially relate to personality traits, including dogmatism, self-esteem, and locus of control. A path analysis supported a developmental theory in which the key events are the development of cynicism and the consequent adoption of a competitive stance toward others. Some of the component beliefs were causally antecedent to variables such as competitiveness, whereas other component beliefs were causally dependent on the same variables. Thus, the Machiavellianism total score cannot enter into a logically consistent causal relation with these variables. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {For climate mitigation to be successful, vast numbers of people must change how they go about daily life. Social scientists have tried to promote environmentally sustainable (i.e. ``green'') behavior with interventions involving cues, frames, and information, but the cumulative impact of those efforts has been modest. A growing number of studies---largely observational---suggests the promise of ``warm glow'' messaging that features the pleasure and satisfaction one experiences from acting sustainably. While past work has established the association between intrinsic motivations and green behavior, our study offers evidence regarding the causal effect of warm glow feelings in the climate domain. In three survey experiments administered on different national samples, we induce feelings of warm glow and examine the impact on green behavioral intentions. The treatment, an adaptation of a standard feeling induction, has a significant influence on a wide range of actions---an effect that is distinct from the influence of general positivity. Most importantly, we observe the largest treatment effects in surprising places: among Republicans, and within this subgroup, on more socially visible activities. Manipulated warm glow also increases intentions to engage in more difficult (e.g. costly, effortful) activities. Our findings are valuable for scholars and practitioners seeking to promote broad-based climate mitigation across the ideological spectrum.},

The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high.

  abstract = {Early in the 16th century, Niccolo Machiavelli acted as chief political advisor to the ruling Medici family in Florence, Italy. The details of his counsel are well known because Machiavelli laid them out for posterity in his 1513 book, The Prince. The gist of his advice for maintaining political control is captured in the phrase "the end justifies the means." According to Machiavelli, a ruler with a clear agenda should be open to any and all effective tactics, including manipulative interpersonal strategies such as flattery and lying. Richard Christie, noticed that Machiavelli's political strategies had parallels in people's everyday social behavior. Christie and his colleagues at Columbia University identified a corresponding personality syndrome, which they dubbed Machiavellianism. The label was chosen to capture a duplicitous interpersonal style assumed to emerge from a broader network of cynical beliefs and pragmatic morality. Christie applied his psychometric expertise to develop a series of questionnaires designed to tap individual differences in Machiavellianism. Those questionnaires, along with the research supporting their construct validity, were presented in Christie and Geis's (1970) book, Studies in Machiavellianism. Of these measures, by far the most popular has been the Mach IV. Used in more than 2,000 cited studies, the scale has proved valuable in studying manipulative tendencies among student, community, and worker samples. The follow-up version, Mach V, was designed as an improvement but, in the end, raised more problems than it solved. Our strategy here is to summarize its conclusions and springboard into the subsequent research. Our emphasis is on the Christie tradition primarily focused on research using his scales. We conclude by discussing new directions in theory and research on Machiavellianism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, it was recently argued by Andr\'e (2022) that if outliers are instead removed across groups, Type I error rates are not inflated. The same study discusses that removing outliers across groups is a specific case of the more general concept of hypothesis-blind removal of outliers, which is consequently recommended. In this paper, I demonstrate that, contrary to this advice, hypothesis-blind outlier removal is problematic. Specifically, it almost always invalidates confidence intervals and biases estimates if there are group differences. It moreover inflates Type I error rates in certain situations, for example, when variances are unequal and data nonnormal. Consequently, a data point may not be removed solely because it is deemed an outlier, whether the procedure used is hypothesis-blind or hypothesis-aware. I conclude by recommending valid alternatives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: {$\bullet$} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. {$\bullet$} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. {$\bullet$} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. {$\bullet$} Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. {$\bullet$} Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. {$\bullet$} In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. {$\bullet$} The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. {$\bullet$} When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. {$\bullet$} Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. {$\bullet$} Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. {$\bullet$} It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

  abstract = {Once thought to be a unidimensional personality trait, recent research has advanced a twodimensional model of Machiavellianism (Monaghan et al., 2020). The views dimension is associated with a cynical worldview whereas the tactics dimension relates to a willingness to engage in interpersonal exploitation for personal gain. The purpose of this study was to explore how these two dimensions are associated with coping strategies (Carver, 1997) in response to interpersonal stress as well as differences in life satisfaction (Kobau et al., 2010) and happiness (Lyubormirsky \& Lepper, 1999). The sample (N = 253) was collected through Prolific, an online paid research panel, and also included measures of self-consciousness (Scheier \& Carver, 2013) and locus of control (Rotter, 1966). Results indicated that Machiavellianism was associated with more destructive coping strategies like behavioral disengagement, denial and substance use. Both views and tactics were positively correlated with destructive strategies. Interestingly, Machiavellian views, but not tactics, was negatively correlated with constructive strategies like planning, emotional support and active coping. GLM mediational analyses indicated that selfblame explained lower levels of life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985) among individuals high in either tactics or views. Emotional support accounted for differences in satisfaction with life among individuals with Machiavellian views, but not tactics.},

With the rise of the internet it has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials, and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo, 2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to test predictions with severity should find value in the practice of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.},

A principled approach to the use of preregistration should not treat all deviations as problematic. Deviations from a preregistered analysis plan can both reduce and increase the severity of a test, as well as increase the validity of inferences. I provide examples of how researchers can present deviations from preregistrations and evaluate the consequences of the deviation when encountering 1) unforeseen events, 2) errors in the preregistration, 3) missing information, 4) violations of untested assumptions, and 5) falsification of auxiliary hypotheses. The current manuscript aims to provide a principled approach to deciding when to deviate from a preregistration and how to report deviations from an error-statistical philosophy grounded in methodological falsificationism. The goal is to help researchers reflect on the consequence of deviations from preregistrations by evaluating the test's severity and the validity of the inference.},

The chance of selecting an optimal model rose as the values of misspecified parameters and sample sizes increased. The relative performance of AIC and BIC type criteria depended on the magnitudes of the parameter misspecified. The BIC family in general outperformed AIC counterparts unless under small values of omitted parameters and sample sizes, where AIC performed better. Scaled unit information prior BIC (SPBIC) and Haughton's BIC (HBIC) demonstrated the highest accuracy ratios across most of the conditions investigated in this simulation.},

This chapter focuses on the error statistical philosophy and concerns the interplay between the philosophical, methodological, and statistical issues, to elucidate long-standing conceptual, technical, and epistemological debates surrounding both dimensions. Standard explications of statistical methods focus on the formal mathematical tools without considering a general philosophy of science or of induction in which these tools best fit.

If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive.

In an independent second sample the resulting EFA structure was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis-based measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) tests in a control group with the original archaic items and a treatment group with eight items rewritten in a more modern vernacular. Specific model testing steps [] and statistical tests [] were applied in a bottom-up approach [] to ME/I tests on these two versions of the Mach IV. The two versions were found to have equal form, equal factor loadings, but unequal indicator error variances. Subsequent item-by-item tests of error invariance resulted in substantial decrements to fit for three revised items suggesting that the error associated with these items was not equal across the two versions.},

An international collaboration (k\,=\,15, N\,=\,17,004; 57.39\% male; aged 11--85, M\,=\,26.97) contributed datasets from Korea, Hungary, Canada, USA, and Australia. We tested a nomological network comprising associations of Machiavellianism's dimensions with demographic variables and four conceptual domains: development (trauma, family functioning, world-view), personality (Big Five, HEXACO, narcissism, psychopathy), emotionality (emotional intelligence, regulation), and behavior (self-report, game scenarios). Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis supported the two-dimensional structure. Men were higher on views and tactics than women, and age did not influence Machiavellianism overall. Mean Machiavellianism varied across national cultures differently for views and tactics. Both dimensions related to adverse developmental experiences and negatively to agreeableness and honesty-humility. The views dimension related to emotionality negatively, and higher distrust and delinquency, whereas the tactics dimension related to aspects of psychopathy, and lower conscientiousness and empathy. Overall, we provide essential theoretical advancements and the foundation for future research into Machiavellianism.},

Thus, this study aimed to investigate associations between Machiavellianism and psychopathology from a multidimensional perspective. The participants were 1478 US undergraduates aged between 18 and 53years (M=19.55, SD=3.22; 39\% male) and 218 Australian undergraduates aged between 17 and 60 (M=20.09, SD=4.56; 33\% male). To address psychometric issues in the Mach-IV scale, item analysis and confirmatory factor analyses were used to derive its multidimensional structure. Structural equation modelling tested unique associations of Machiavellian views and tactics with six psychopathological constructs: depression, fear, anxiety, impulsivity, externalising psychopathology, and thought dysfunction. Results from the US and Australian samples suggest that Machiavellianism is best viewed as a two-dimensional construct consisting of views and tactics. Furthermore, the US study showed that Machiavellian views uniquely predicted all areas of psychopathology, whereas tactics predicted only externalising domains. These findings demonstrate the multidimensional nature of Machiavellianism and highlight its distinctive psychopathological implications.},

The 2-factor structure fitted the data well based on CFA, and was invariant across samples, gender, and over a 3-month period (N = 338, 36.39\% men). Evidence of each subscale's construct validity was established using structural equation modeling. As expected, the Views subscale was primarily associated with misanthropy, hypersensitive narcissism, lower subjective well-being, and lower emotional stability. The Tactics subscale was primarily associated with psychopathy, lower conscientiousness, lower willingness to reciprocate, and 'ends justified the means' behavior in ethical dilemmas. The TDMS enhances practical and conceptual understanding of Machiavellianism through demarcating the underlying motivations and addresses the need for an updated and psychometrically sound measure of Machiavellianism.

Just as radio and television are now commonplace in our everyday lives, simulation methods are now widely used throughout the many branches of statistics, as can be readily appreciated from reading Chapters 1 and 9. The book has grown out of a fifteen-hour lecture course given to third-year mathematics undergraduates at the University of Kent, and it could be used either as an undergraduate or a postgraduate text. Simulation may either be taught as an operational research tool in its own right, or as a mathematical method which cements together different parts of statistics and which may be used in a variety of lecture courses. In the last three chapters indications are made of the varied uses of simulation throughout statistics. Alternatively, simulation may be used to motivate subjects such as the teaching of distribution theory and the manipulation of random variables, and Chapters 4 and 5 especially will hopefully be useful in this respect.},

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some ``truth'' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume~34 of               Statistics in Medicine               , which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

At this time, mean height was 5.0 m, stand basal area was 9.6 m2 ha-1, volume was 29.7 m3 ha-1, LAI was 3.5, and foliage mass was 7.3 Mg ha-1. Water use by eucalypts was consistently higher than by pines, commensurate with their more rapid early growth, but the difference was not in proportion to the difference in leaf area. In the third year (when the eucalypts had a closed canopy), the eucalypts used 22\% more water than the pines, but the annual mean LAI of the eucalypts was three times greater than that of the pines. The results suggest that (1) plantation water use by the two species on the same site will be similar for the same stage of canopy development, (2) eucalypts are not inherently more profligate consumers of water than pines when soil water is not limiting, and (3) stomatal control limits growth and water use of E. grandis in arid environments.},

  abstract = {We present a theoretical model to quantify the influence of diversity on productivity and nutrient acquisition in plant communities during exponential growth. The model fractionates diversity into three components, namely species richness (S), species evenness (E ) and the degree of difference between species (D). The influence of each of these components is assessed individually: S is varied by changing the number of species, E by changing their population size, and D by changing the range of species traits critical to productivity (specific nutrient uptake rate, {$\Sigma$}r, or nutrient use efficiency, NUE). D was quantified as the coefficient of variation of {$\Sigma$}r or NUE. All three components of diversity enhance the biomass and nutrient stocks in the community, but the response patterns are different. Species richness has a saturating influence, whereas effects of E and D are linear and exponential, respectively. In all cases the non-linear dependence of productivity and nutrient acquisition on {$\Sigma$}r and NUE during exponential growth was the single mechanism underlying these effects. This causes the presence of plants with extreme traits to promote productivity, and S, E and D all affect the abundance and/or intensity of these extremes. The model offers a framework to explain differences between experimental observations, and suggests a concept of diversity where S and E are structural components and D a qualitative or functional component, which modulates the influence of the two others. We propose to explicitly recognise D as an integral constituent of plant diversity in future studies.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes---a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

Consequently, many researchers believe that preregistration is only applicable in confirmatory paradigms.In practice, researchers may struggle to preregister their hypotheses because of vague theories that necessitate data-dependent decisions (aka exploration).We argue that preregistration benefits any study on the continuum between confirmatory and exploratory research.To that end, we formalize a general objective of preregistration and demonstrate that exploratory studies also benefit from preregistration.Drawing on Bayesian philosophy of science, we argue that preregistration should primarily aim to reduce uncertainty about the inferential procedure used to derive results.This approach provides a principled justification of preregistration, separating the procedure from the goal of ensuring strictly confirmatory research.We acknowledge that knowing the extent to which a study is exploratory is central, but certainty about the inferential procedure is a prerequisite for persuasive evidence.Finally, we discuss the implications of these insights for the practice of preregistration.},

Scientific theories are said to be systems of statements which logically imply some singular, existential propositions which in principle could be falsified by empirical observations. Metaphysical theories lack such implications but many scientific theories have been derived historically from metaphysical speculations. The latter are not meaningless but only untestable as initially formulated. No scientific theory is established as a truth about reality, but is vindicated for the purposes of a discipline by repeated failures to falsify it by means of approved empirical methods. The probability value of theories is interpreted in parallel terms. The concepts of testability and simplicity are systematically examined. Applications are made to a number of controversies in recent and contemporary physics. Some attempt is made to show the relationship between the defended position and the positions of various historical thinkers and schools of thought.

  abstract = {Being good at discerning what another person needs does not mean that you will necessarily meet those needs. No personality style illustrates this more powerfully than the Machiavellian, where empathy is either lacking or bypassed. In such a person, skill in mapping the intentional states of others, that is, having a good theory of mind, is a basis for the exercise of sneaky power. The personality style of Machiavellianism is here as a case study relevant to ToM, because Machs are strategic manipulators who are able to map the intentional states of others. Yet there is a puzzle at the heart of these manipulative abilities. To successfully manipulate another, that is, to align his motivation with one's own goals, one needs to discern the beliefs, affective states, and need states of that other, in order to influence them to one's own advantage. Yet research suggests that those high in Mach tendencies not only lack empathy, but lack skill in correctly recognizing the expressive cues of others. How then are the beliefs, affective states, and need states of others discerned? The ability to map such states is central to ToM concerns. Machs seem to be able to map even affective states without using affective processes. What are the consequences for development of a disorder of empathy in conjunction with an intact ToM? The author first makes a case for the relevance of individual differences to ToM. She then sketches the views and tactics that the Mach scales measure and discuss definitions of empathy. She then uses Machiavellianism as a case study of a disorder of empathy. [Author abstract, ed]},

Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},

  abstract = {In psychology, preregistration is the most widely used method to ensure the confirmatory status of analyses. However, the method has disadvantages: Not only is it perceived as effortful and time-consuming, but reasonable deviations from the analysis plan demote the status of the study to exploratory. An alternative to preregistration is analysis blinding, in which researchers develop their analysis on an altered version of the data. In this experimental study, we compare the reported efficiency and convenience of the two methods in the context of the Many-Analysts Religion Project. In this project, 120 teams answered the same research questions on the same data set, either preregistering their analysis (n = 61) or using analysis blinding (n = 59). Our results provide strong evidence (Bayes factor [BF] = 71.40) for the hypothesis that analysis blinding leads to fewer deviations from the analysis plan, and if teams deviated, they did so on fewer aspects. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found strong evidence (BF = 13.19) that both methods required approximately the same amount of time. Finally, we found no and moderate evidence on whether analysis blinding was perceived as less effortful and frustrating, respectively. We conclude that analysis blinding does not mean less work, but researchers can still benefit from the method because they can plan more appropriate analyses from which they deviate less frequently.},

These indices, however, can point to conflicting conclusions about the extent to which a model actually matches the observed data. The present article provides some guide-lines that should help applied researchers to evaluate the adequacy of a given struc-tural equation model. First, as goodness-of-fit measures depend on the method used for parameter estimation, maximum likelihood (ML) and weighted least squares (WLS) methods are introduced in the context of structural equation modeling. Then, the most common goodness-of-fit indices are discussed and some recommendations for practitioners given. Finally, we generated an artificial data set according to a "true" model and analyzed two misspecified and two correctly specified models as examples of poor model fit, adequate fit, and good fit. In structural equation modeling (SEM), a model is said to fit the observed data to the extent that the model-implied covariance matrix is equivalent to the empirical co-variance matrix. Once a model has been specified and the empirical covariance matrix is given, a method has to be selected for parameter estimation. Different estimation meth-ods have different distributional assumptions and have different discrepancy functions to be minimized. When the estimation procedure has converged to a reasonable},

However, the quality of simulation studies can vary widely in terms of their design, execution, and reporting. In order to assess the quality of typical simulation studies in psychology, we reviewed 321 articles published in Psychological Methods, Behavior Research Methods, and Multivariate Behavioral Research in 2021 and 2022, among which 100/321 = 31.2\% report a simulation study. We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from  adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide ADEMP-PreReg, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the ADEMP framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre--post measurement experiments.},

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

Therefore, we sought to elucidate the factorial structure and neural substrates of child and adolescent intelligence using two cross-sectional, developmental samples (CALM: N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 551 (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 165 imaging), age range: 5--18 years, NKI-Rockland: N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 337 (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 65 imaging), age range: 6--18 years). In a preregistered analysis, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the neuro\- cognitive architecture of individual differences in childhood and adolescent cognitive ability. In both samples, we found that cognitive ability in lower and typical-ability cohorts is best understood as two separable con\- structs, crystallized and fluid intelligence, which became more distinct across development, in line with the age differentiation hypothesis. Further analyses revealed that white matter microstructure, most prominently the superior longitudinal fasciculus, was strongly associated with crystallized (gc) and fluid (gf) abilities. Finally, we used SEM trees to demonstrate evidence for developmental reorganization of gc and gf and their white matter substrates such that the relationships among these factors dropped between 7--8 years before increasing around age 10. Together, our results suggest that shortly before puberty marks a pivotal phase of change in the neu\- rocognitive architecture of intelligence.},

  abstract = {The design and analysis of Monte Carlo experiments, with special reference to structural equation modelling, is discussed in this article. These topics merit consideration, since the validity of the conclusions drawn from a Monte Carlo study clearly hinges on these features. It is argued that comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments can be implemented on a PC if the experiments are adequately designed. This is especially important when investigating modern computer intensive methodologies like resampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We are faced with three fundamental challenges in Monte Carlo experimentation. The first problem is statistical precision, which concerns the reliability of the obtained results. External validity, on the other hand, depends on the number of experimental conditions, and is crucial for the prospects of generalising the results beyond the specific experiment. Finally, we face the constraint on available computer resources. The conventional wisdom in designing and analysing Monte Carlo experiments embodies no explicit specification of meta-model for analysing the output of the experiment, the use of case studies or full factorial designs as experimental plans, no use of variance reduction techniques, a large number of replications, and "eyeballing" of the results. A critical examination of the conventional wisdom is presented in this article. We suggest that the following alternative procedures should be considered. First of all, we argue that it is profitable to specify explicit meta-models, relating the chosen performance statistics and experimental conditions. Regarding the experimental plan, we recommend the use of incomplete designs, which will often result in considerable savings. We also consider the use of common random numbers in the simulation phase, since this may enhance the precision in estimating meta-models. The use of fewer replications per trial, enabling us to investigate an increased number of experimental conditions, should also be considered in order to improve the external validity at the cost of the conventionally excessive precision.},

Results: The results show a greater tendency for the items in the Positive questionnaire to show results associated with the directionality of the items. However, this questionnaire shows higher values of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and better fit of the theoretical factor structure. Conclusions: In the survey that included only positive items, findings indicated the existence of acquiescence bias. However, a remedy to this situation only made matters worse, as the combination of positive and negative items seriously affected the internal consistency of the scales.},

As such, these campaigns have neglected the possibility that decisions to act environmentally-friendly can also be preceded by ``valuation by feeling'', where anticipated positive feelings drive people's intention to act environmentally-friendly. Acting environmentally-friendly can be driven by anticipated positive feelings because it can be intrinsically rewarding to contribute to the good cause. Indeed, across two studies we found that the stronger people anticipated to feel good about acting environmentally-friendly, the stronger their intention was to act environmentally-friendly. Importantly, anticipated positive feelings were a much stronger predictor of people's intention to act environmentally-friendly compared to the perceived quantity of the benefits of pro-environmental actions. This indicates that environmental campaigns that resonate with people' feelings, instead of exclusively appealing to their calculations, may be an important unexploited route to encourage pro-environmental behavior.},

The data are based on the German cohort study lidA (living at work), which links survey data individually with employment register data. Based on social security data, the income of men and women over time are analyzed using a multilevel analysis. The results show that the GPG exists in Germany over the life course: men have a higher daily average income per year than women. In addition, the income developments of men rise more sharply than those of women over time. Moreover, even after controlling for factors potentially explaining the GPG like education, work experience, occupational status or unemployment episodes the GPG persists. Concluding, further research is required that covers additional factors like individual behavior or information about the labor market structure for a better understanding of the GPG.},

At present, they are located mainly in the Iberian Peninsula and Eucalyptus globulus is the most commonly planted species. Climate forecasts anticipate an expansion of Eucalyptus to other regions of Europe. The fast growth of E. globulus, together with its resprouting ability and wood properties, has promoted the use of this species in the Iberian Peninsula. The total volume of E. globulus harvested there was close to 14 million m3 in 2019. Eucalyptus species represent the main source of raw material for the pulp and paper industries and provide an important source of income to non-industrial owners. Being exotic fast-growing trees, their expansion has also been associated with negative environmental impacts. The species therefore poses a series of challenges, while also generating opportunities. The objectives of this review paper are: (1) to summarize the importance of Eucalyptus plantations in Europe; (2) to analyse the opportunities and challenges of this genus in present and future plantations in Europe; (3) to assess to what extent forest management, at both stand and landscape levels, can reduce negative impacts; (4) to make policy and management recommendations that may support the use of this genus in other European regions. These aims are accomplished based on a thorough literature review, particularly focused on research developed in the Iberian Peninsula.},

METHODS: All RCTs published between 2015 and 2021 were systematically extracted from 4 behavioral medicine journals and analyzed based on prespecified inclusion criteria. Two independent raters classified each of the manuscripts into 1 of 5 RCT analysis strategies. RESULTS: There was wide variation in the methods used. The 2 most prevalent analyses for RCTs were longitudinal modeling and analysis of covariance. Application of method varied significantly by sample size. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Each statistical analysis presents its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The information resulting from this research may prove helpful for researchers in palliative care and behavioral medicine in navigating the variety of statistical methods available. Future discussion around best practices in RCT analyses is warranted to compare the relative impact of interventions in a more standardized way.},

  abstract = {In this study, we assessed the extent of selective hypothesis reporting in psychological research by comparing the hypotheses found in a set of 459 preregistrations with the hypotheses found in the corresponding articles. We found that more than half of the preregistered studies we assessed contained omitted hypotheses (N = 224; 52\%) or added hypotheses (N = 227; 57\%), and about one-fifth of studies contained hypotheses with a direction change (N = 79; 18\%). We found only a small number of studies with hypotheses that were demoted from primary to secondary importance (N = 2; 1\%) and no studies with hypotheses that were promoted from secondary to primary importance. In all, 60\% of studies included at least one hypothesis in one or more of these categories, indicating a substantial bias in presenting and selecting hypotheses by researchers and/or reviewers/editors. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find sufficient evidence that added hypotheses and changed hypotheses were more likely to be statistically significant than nonselectively reported hypotheses. For the other types of selective hypothesis reporting, we likely did not have sufficient statistical power to test for a relationship with statistical significance. Finally, we found that replication studies were less likely to include selectively reported hypotheses than original studies. In all, selective hypothesis reporting is problematically common in psychological research. We urge researchers, reviewers, and editors to ensure that hypotheses outlined in preregistrations are clearly formulated and accurately presented in the corresponding articles.},

  abstract = {Study preregistration has become increasingly popular in psychology, but its potential to restrict researcher degrees of freedom has not yet been empirically verified. We used an extensive protocol to assess the producibility (i.e., the degree to which a study can be properly conducted based on the available information) of preregistrations and the consistency between preregistrations and their corresponding papers for 300 psychology studies. We found that preregistrations often lack methodological details and that undisclosed deviations from preregistered plans are frequent. These results highlight that biases due to researcher degrees of freedom remain possible in many preregistered studies. More comprehensive registration templates typically yielded more producible preregistrations. We did not find that the producibility and consistency of preregistrations differed over time or between original and replication studies. Furthermore, we found that operationalizations of variables were generally preregistered more producible and consistently than other study parts. Inconsistencies between preregistrations and published studies were mainly encountered for data collection procedures, statistical models, and exclusion criteria. Our results indicate that, to unlock the full potential of preregistration, researchers in psychology should aim to write more producible preregistrations, adhere to these preregistrations more faithfully, and more transparently report any deviations from their preregistrations. This could be facilitated by training and education to improve preregistration skills, as well as the development of more comprehensive templates.},

In this project, we compared 193 psychology studies that earned a Preregistration Challenge prize or preregistration badge to 193 related studies that were not preregistered. In contrast to our theoretical expectations and prior research, we did not find that preregistered studies had a lower proportion of positive results (Hypothesis 1), smaller effect sizes (Hypothesis 2), or fewer statistical errors (Hypothesis 3) than non-preregistered studies. Supporting our Hypotheses 4 and 5, we found that preregistered studies more often contained power analyses and typically had larger sample sizes than non-preregistered studies. Finally, concerns about the publishability and impact of preregistered studies seem unwarranted, as preregistered studies did not take longer to publish and scored better on several impact measures. Overall, our data indicate that preregistration has beneficial effects in the realm of statistical power and impact, but we did not find robust evidence that preregistration prevents p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).},

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology's academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result---a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label ``confirmatory,'' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled ``exploratory.'' We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

The author presents some empirical results highlighting problems that lower the trustworthiness of reported results in scientific literatures, including that of animal welfare studies. Some of the underlying causes of these biases are discussed based on the notion that researchers are only human and hence are not immune to confirmation bias, hindsight bias, and minor ethical transgressions. The author discusses solutions in the form of enhanced transparency, sharing of data and materials, (post-publication) peer review, pre-registration, registered reports, improved training, reporting guidelines, replication, dealing with publication bias, alternative inferential techniques, power, and other statistical tools.},

  abstract = {Psychological scientists are increasingly using preregistration as a tool to increase the credibility of research findings. Many of the benefits of preregistration rest on the assumption that preregistered plans are followed perfectly. However, research suggests that this is the exception rather than the norm, and there are many reasons why researchers may deviate from their preregistered plans. Preregistration can still be a valuable tool, even in the presence of deviations, as long as those deviations are well documented and transparently reported. Unfortunately, most preregistration deviations in psychology go unreported or are reported in unsystematic ways. In the current article, we offer a solution to this problem by providing a framework for transparent and standardized reporting of preregistration deviations, which was developed by drawing on our own experiences with preregistration, existing unpublished templates, feedback from colleagues and reviewers, and the results of a survey of 34 psychology-journal editors. This framework provides a clear template for what to do when things do not go as planned. We conclude by encouraging researchers to adopt this framework in their own preregistered research and by suggesting that journals implement structural policies around the transparent reporting of preregistration deviations.},

  abstract = {Changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, nutrient enrichment, and environmental stress often lead to reduced plant diversity in ecosystems. However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of the dominant. Our results are largely consistent with the idea that human-influenced reductions in small-scale plant diversity, in this case evenness, will lead to indirect reductions in total primary productivity. Furthermore, because the evenness treatments were not confounded with species identity, our results suggest that diversity has an effect on plant productivity above and beyond the sampling effect (having a higher probability of species with higher growth rates in diverse communities) seen in studies that vary species richness.},

TSF has negative effect on species richness and Shannon's index, and a positive effect on species evenness.

  abstract = {Conjecture about the weak replicability in social sciences has made scholars eager to quantify the scale and scope of replication failure for a discipline. Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126 papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine learning model that estimates a paper's likelihood of replication, we found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a single overall replication rate of Psychology poorly captures the varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authors' cumulative publication number and citation impact are positively related to the likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and rigor, such as an author's university prestige and a paper's citations, are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication failure. Our assessments of the scale and scope of replicability are important next steps toward broadly resolving issues of replicability.},
