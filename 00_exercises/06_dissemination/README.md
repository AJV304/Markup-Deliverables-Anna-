# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

In this folder exercise 1 of week 6 in which we were asked to create a package can be found under RoundR. The package should give 0 errors and warnings but might give 1 note. This is because my laptop time is not correct and therefore the package had problems with timestamping. But since I like having my laptop be a few minutes fast, I chose not to change it. I also did not add a doi because I feel like it's a waste of internet space to add a doi to this exercise package.
