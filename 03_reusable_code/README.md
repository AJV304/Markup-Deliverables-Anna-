# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 3: Reusable `R` code wrapped in a `Shiny` app.

For deliverable 3 I have chosen to make a Shiny app about Titanic data. 

- If `Shiny app`, link the app on a `Shiny` server and your development repository (on GitHub).

See course manual for requirements.
